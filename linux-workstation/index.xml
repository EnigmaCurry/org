      <description>A Linux Workstation is a single user computer that you use as your primary interface for computing, especially for &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; purposes. At a bare minimum, a workstation includes a keyboard to type on, and a display to display things on. Historically, there has been a hardware distinction between a personal computer (PC) and a Unix workstation, but ever since the introduction of Linux, the difference in hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t really exist anymore, and any computing device can become a workstation.</description>

      <description>I have tried a great many different Linux distributions over the years, but I have recently settled on using Fedora Sway Atomic for my desktop and laptop workstations.
Sway is a minimal tiling window manager for Wayland. It is ideal for efficient keyboard centric development and for getting out of your way.
The &amp;ldquo;Atomic&amp;rdquo; part refers to rpm-ostree which was developed by the CoreOS team to build an operating system that is built entirely to support containers.</description>

      <description>You will need the following hardware:
An x86_64 desktop or laptop computer. A USB drive for copying the .iso installer to. A solokey or other FIDO2 compatible hardware authentication key. (This is optional, but highly recommended for storing secure shell keys, PGP keys, and logging into websites with Webauthn.) </description>

      <description>Download the Fedora Sway Atomic iso image.
Assuming you are temporarily using another Linux workstation, write the .iso image to a USB drive (eg. replace /dev/sdX with your device name):
dd if=Fedora-Sericea-ostree-x86_64-39-1.5-respin2.iso \ of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=progress conv=syncBoot the target workstation computer using the USB drive. You will boot into the Anaconda install wizard. Just follow the prompts to install it, it is exactly the same as any other Fedora / Redhat install.</description>
