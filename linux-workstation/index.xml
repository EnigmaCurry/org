      <description>A Linux Workstation is a single user computer that you use as your primary interface for computing, especially for &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; purposes. At a bare minimum, a workstation includes a keyboard to type on, and a display to display things on. Historically, there has been a hardware distinction between a personal computer (PC) and a Unix workstation, but ever since the introduction of Linux, the difference in hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t really exist anymore, and any computing device can become a workstation.</description>

      <title>Fedora Sway Atomic</title>

      <description>I have tried a great many different Linux distributions over the years, but I have recently settled on using Fedora Sway Atomic for my desktop and laptop workstations.
Sway is a minimal tiling window manager for Wayland. It is ideal for efficient keyboard centric development and for getting out of your way.
The &amp;ldquo;Atomic&amp;rdquo; part refers to rpm-ostree which was developed by the CoreOS team to build an operating system that is built entirely to support containers.</description>

      <description>You will need the following hardware:
An x86_64 desktop or laptop computer. A USB drive for copying the .iso installer to. A solokey or other FIDO2 compatible hardware authentication key. (This is optional, but highly recommended for storing secure shell keys, PGP keys, and logging into websites with Webauthn.) </description>

      <title>Installation</title>

      <description>Create USB installation media Download the Fedora Sway Atomic iso image.
Assuming you are temporarily using another Linux workstation, write the .iso image to a USB drive (eg. replace /dev/sdX with your device name):
dd if=Fedora-Sericea-ostree-x86_64-39-1.5-respin2.iso \ of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=progress conv=syncBoot the target workstation computer using the USB drive. You will boot into the Anaconda install wizard. Just follow the prompts to install it, it is exactly the same as any other Fedora / Redhat install.</description>

      <description>Fedora Atomic ships with the Firefox browser preinstalled. This section describes how I like to set it up.
Remove clutter Remove Firefox View, right click the upper left icon and select Remove from toolbar. Remove existing bookmarks from bookmark bar, right click each one and select Delete. Remove Pocket, right click the pocket icon in the upper right toolbar, select Remove from toolbar Remove Firefox Account icon, select Remove from toolbar Firefox Settings Go into the Firefox settings: click the &amp;ldquo;hamburger&amp;rdquo; menu in the top right toolbar.</description>

      <description>Toolbox is an integral part of Fedora Atomic, being one of the main methods of installing software (the alternative being Flatpak), it lets you run your applications inside of Podman containers. Toolbox can actually be used on any Linux system that is capable of running Podman, but is especially useful on Atomic hosts. Toolbox is more tightly integrated with your host OS than Docker or Podman containers normally are. Toolbox containers share the same /home directory with the host (bind mounted), and they live in the same network and process namespace as the host (ie.</description>

      <title>Emacs</title>
      <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/emacs-on-fedora/index.html</link>

      <description>Emacs is my long time favorite code editor (IDE) and for writing documentation (including this book).
Install Emacs Because Sway runs on Wayland, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to install the Wayland (pgtk) version of Emacs. In Fedora 40 onwards, the Wayland (pgtk) version is already the default. For Fedora 39, you can use this COPR (a COPR is to Fedora what PPA is to Ubuntu and what AUR is to Arch Linux), which includes a custom build for Wayland (pgtk).</description>

      <description>SSH (secure shell) is a secure networking tool used between a client and a server. Using an encrypted network protocol, it can be used to securely login to a server remotely, as well as for more advanded networking scenarios. Typical use cases for SSH include:
Access to a server&amp;rsquo;s console shell, remotely. Transfer files between the server and client (using rsync, scp, or sftp). Create network tunnels to access private servers, in both directions, either on the server, or on the client.</description>
