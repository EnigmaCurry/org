      <description>A Linux Workstation is a single user computer that you use as your primary interface for computing, especially for “work” purposes. At a bare minimum, a workstation includes a keyboard and a display (although a workstation could also be a VPS that you SSH into, this book will focus on physical workstations).&#xA;Historically, there has been a hardware distinction between a personal computer (PC) and a Unix workstation, but ever since the introduction of Linux, the difference in hardware doesn’t really matter anymore, and any computing device can become a workstation.</description>

      <title>Install Linux (Fedora Atomic)</title>

      <description>Create USB installation media Download Fedora Sway Atomic.iso Temporarily using another Linux workstation, write the .iso image to a USB drive:&#xA;Run this on the computer that will write the USB sudo dd if=~/Downloads/Fedora-Sericea-ostree-x86_64-40-1.14.iso \ of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=progress conv=sync Info Replace /dev/sdX with your device name, and double check the .iso filename you downloaded, it may have changed.&#xA;Tip If you are borrowing a Windows computer, then download a program like unetbootin to write the .</description>

      <title>Upgrading</title>

      <description>As mentioned before, Fedora Atomic is distributed as a full system image. You can both upgrade the image, as well as rollback the image (in case you have any issues with the upgrade.)&#xA;To upgrade to the latest image:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: sudo rpm-ostree upgrade Let it finish downloading the new image, and then you must reboot:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: sudo systemctl reboot The boot manager lists the last several images, which are still available to choose from.</description>

      <title>Layering packages</title>
      <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/layering-packages/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/layering-packages/index.html</guid>
      <description>See the Fedora docs for Adding Layered Packages.&#xA;Warning On a Fedora Atomic host, you should only layer packages as a last resort. You should prefer running apps from a container (toolbox) instead. Layering packages should be reserved only for those applications that need to interact with the system in a way that using containers would be inconvenient or impossible.&#xA;Layer packages with rpm-ostree To create efficient layers, and to lessen the burden of several reboots, you should try to install everything in one go, using as few layers as possible.</description>

      <title>Solokey authentication</title>

      <description>Solokeys are physical hardware authentication (U2F / FIDO2) devices, that you plug into a USB port, which stores a secret key that can be used as primary or secondary authentication factors (2FA), with websites (Webauthn), and machines (sudo and SSH).&#xA;There are two versions of solokey now, v1 and v2, and they require separate toolchains. The instructions diverge here depending on which hardware revision you have.&#xA;Index Get your Solokey Solokey v2 Solokey v1 Sudo with Solokey SSH with Solokey </description>

      <description>With strong authentication for sudo taken care of by Solokey, we can separate permissions for privileged data access, by creating additional user accounts.&#xA;One use case for this can be to control access to command line programs that store sensitive API tokens, via sudo.&#xA;Index DigitalOcean CLI (doctl) </description>

      <title>KVM / libvirt</title>
      <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/kvm-libvirt/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/kvm-libvirt/index.html</guid>
      <description>Idealistically, the introduction declared a “No Sworkstations” rule (No Server-Workstations). Pragmatically, you can bend this rule a bit, by hosting some development servers inside of virtual machines (VM). Hosting VMs on your workstation is convenient for having a portable lab environment. By using virtual machines for all services, we get to maintain our core distinction between the roles of workstation and server.&#xA;This paradigm is considerably more adhoc than a proper hypervisor operating system like Proxmox.</description>

      <title>Firewall</title>

      <description>Firewalld Firewalld is an abstraction of nftables (which is an abstraction of netfilter). Firewalld is installed on Fedora systems by default, and it is what is used to configure the system firewall.&#xA;Firewalld rules are grouped into zones. There can be multiple zones, and you may switch between them. There can only be one active zone per network interface.&#xA;Don’t mess with it Warning Fedora Atomic installs a good default zone for workstation use, named public.</description>
