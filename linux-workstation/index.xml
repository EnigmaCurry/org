      <description>A Linux Workstation is a single user computer that you use as your primary interface for computing, especially for “work” purposes. At a bare minimum, a workstation includes a keyboard to type on, and a display to display things on. Historically, there has been a hardware distinction between a personal computer (PC) and a Unix workstation, but ever since the introduction of Linux, the difference in hardware doesn’t really exist anymore, and any computing device can become a workstation.</description>

      <title>Install Linux (Fedora Atomic)</title>
      <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/linux-workstation/install/index.html</link>

      <description>Create USB installation media Download the Fedora Sway Atomic iso image. Assuming you are temporarily using another Linux workstation, write the .iso image to a USB drive:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: dd if=Fedora-Sericea-ostree-x86_64-40-1.14.iso \ of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=progress conv=sync Info Replace /dev/sdX with your device name, and double check the .iso filename, it may have changed.&#xA;Boot the target workstation computer using the USB drive. You will boot into the Anaconda install wizard.</description>

      <title>Upgrading</title>

      <description>As mentioned before, Fedora Atomic is distributed as a full system image. You can both upgrade the image, as well as rollback the image (in case you have any issues with the upgrade.)&#xA;To upgrade to the latest image:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: sudo rpm-ostree upgrade Let it finish downloading the new image, and then you must reboot:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: sudo systemctl reboot The boot manager lists the last several images, which are still available to choose from.</description>

      <description>See the Fedora docs for Adding Layered Packages&#xA;To create efficient layers, you should try to install everything you want into as few layers as possible.&#xA;Here is a list of packages you might want to add all together as one layer:&#xA;[bash]: Run this on your workstation: sudo rpm-ostree install qemu-kvm libvirt virt-manager virt-viewer \ virt-install libvirt-daemon-config-network libvirt-daemon-kvm \ libguestfs-tools python3-libguestfs virt-top \ gvfs-smb gvfs-archive gvfs-nfs gvfs-fuse gvfs-mtp Check the list of layers:</description>
