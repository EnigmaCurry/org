    <title>Set up public SSH :: book.rymcg.tech</title>
    <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/portable-docker/set-up-public-ssh-reverse-tunnel/index.html</link>
    <description>This chapter will focus on creating an out-of-band backup SSH tunnel (non-WireGuard, non-Traefik based), using a public gateway port on the sentry. This backdoor connection will ensure that you retain access to the Raspberry Pi even during emergency maintenance cycles, including restarting Traefik, restarting Docker, or even rebooting the system (the persistent tunnels will be restarted on boot).&#xA;Ensure the SSH server is secure During the rpi-imager configuration, you should have selected the option for SSH to Allow public-key authentication only.</description>
