    <description>Now that the VPN is active, you can create a public route to access the SSH console of the Raspberry Pi from anywhere.&#xA;Ensure the SSH server is secure During the rpi-imager configuration, you should have selected the option for SSH to Allow public-key authentication only. You should double-check that this setting was applied:&#xA;Run this on the Raspberry Pi cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep &#34;^PasswordAuthentication&#34; (stdout) PasswordAuthentication no If correctly setup, it should show that PasswordAuthentication is disabled (thus requring the use of keys rather than passwords).</description>
