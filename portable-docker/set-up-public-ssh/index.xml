    <description>Now that the VPN is active, you can create a public route to access the SSH console of the Raspberry Pi from anywhere.&#xA;Warning This might seem like a good idea, but there is currently a problem with this configuration: everytime you restart Traefik and/or WireGuard you will lose your connection. A backend channel that is maintained outside of this configuration would make remote adminstration more robust.&#xA;Ensure the SSH server is secure During the rpi-imager configuration, you should have selected the option for SSH to Allow public-key authentication only.</description>
