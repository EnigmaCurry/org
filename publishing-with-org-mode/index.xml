      <description>This site is built with:
Emacs Org-mode Ox-hugo Hugo (extended edition) GitHub actions (also compatible with Gitea actions) The GitHub/Gitea actions file includes all its dependencies declaratively.
To build locally, you must install Emacs (29+), and hugo (v0.120+), using your package manager, or by downloading directly from their respective project pages. Please be aware that hugo has two editions: standard and extended, and this build requires the extended edition (TODO: verify this - I had some problems before - but maybe they are resolved - I am still using the extended edition for now).</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use GitHub pages, you can alternatively publish to any webserver via SFTP.
To do so, you must install Rclone.
For example, on Fedora:
# On Fedora atomic, make sure to do this in a toolbox container: sudo dnf install rcloneOnce installed, you need to configure the remote SFTP server you want to publish to:
rclone configFollow the prompts to setup your SFTP remote, or you can see the example SFTP documentation for doing this.</description>
