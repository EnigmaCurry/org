      <description>This site is built with:
Emacs Org-mode Ox-hugo Hugo (extended edition) GitHub actions (also compatible with Gitea actions) The GitHub/Gitea actions file includes all its dependencies declaratively.
To build locally, you must install Emacs (29+), and hugo (v0.120+), using your package manager, or by downloading directly from their respective project pages. Please be aware that hugo has two editions: standard and extended, and this build requires the extended edition (TODO: verify this - I had some problems before - but maybe they are resolved - I am still using the extended edition for now).</description>
