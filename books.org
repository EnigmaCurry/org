This site holds a collection of books written by EnigmaCurry.

In HTML form, book titles are shown as the top-level headings in the
table of contents, in the left-side menu bar. This site is presented
as a book of books, so you can read through the entire site simply by
navigating through to the next page, until you get to the end. Use
your keyboard arrow keys, left and right, to flip backwards and
forwards through the pages. Alternatively, use the arrow buttons at
the top right of the page.

If you have Javascript enabled, you may use the search box to search
through all the books. (TODO: does it actually work?)
