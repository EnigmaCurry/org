This repository contains a collection of books written by EnigmaCurry.

In HTML form, the menu bar on the left contains the table of contents
and shows the book titles as top level headings. The entire site is
presented as a book of books, so you can read through them all simply
by navigating through to the next page, until you get to the end. Use
your keyboard arrow keys, left and right, to flip backwards and
forwards through the pages. If you are using a touch screen interface,
use the arrow buttons at the top right of the page to flip through the
pages.
