      <description>What is self-hosting? Self-hosting is the practice of hosting network applications (web / internet / LAN / etc), using your own server hardware, or at least on virtual machines that you fundamentally control (ie. you have root access). As a preparedness skill, the self-hoster prioritizes the use of open source software, as it becomes an inalienable toolset to bootstrap infrastructure in the wilderness.
You can apply self-hosting a little bit, or a lot.</description>

      <title>Register a domain name</title>

      <description>To host a web service, one of the first things you will need is to register your domain name. This will be the domain name used for all of your service links, and it is what your users will need to type into their browsers (or click on) to visit your pages.
Domain names are a scarce resource. Because of their scarcity, you must pay for your domain registrations, doing so in 1 year increments.</description>

      <title>Setup public DNS</title>

      <description>A DNS server maps your domain (and subdomain) names to the various IP addresses of your servers. DNS is required for your users to be able to type your domain name prod.example.com and have it resolve to the IP address that is required to contact your Docker server.
Now that you have registered a domain name, you need to tell your registrar where your DNS server is. Usually you will use the DNS server that your cloud provider gives you, but you may choose any DNS provider you like.</description>

      <title>Create a Docker server</title>

      <description>The next three chapters will guide you to install Docker, for three different server scenarios:
A production, public Docker server on the Internet (eg. hosted at DigitalOcean, or any other VPS cloud, and/or bare-metal server). A production/staging Docker server on a private LAN (eg. a Raspberry Pi). A development Docker server in a Proxmox VM. If you only care about a particular scenario, you may now want to skip directly to the appropriate chapter.</description>

      <description>This section will guide you to create your own public Docker server as a DigitalOcean droplet, however you may also install Docker on any cloud provider or dedicated host that you prefer.
Choosing a VPS provider One of the most basic units of cloud computing is the Virtual Private Server (VPS). A VPS is a (Linux) virtual machine that is provisioned by a cloud service, and you are given root access to fully administer it, to install whatever you want on it.</description>

      <description>Create a VM
Setup private DNS If you chose a fake domain, you can set the DNS record on your local DNS server. Generally, most LANs already have a local DNS server install on a home router. You can add your records there. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a DNS server, you can install dnsmasq. dnsmasq can act as DNS and/or DHCP servers for your LAN.
A dnsmasq entry for the wildcard records would look like this (in dnsmasq.</description>
