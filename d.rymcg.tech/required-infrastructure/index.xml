    <description>A public internet Docker server needs several resources that you need to procure :&#xA;A domain name registrar (eg. Gandi.net). A domain name server (eg. DigitalOcean DNS). A Linux compute platform on which to install Docker (eg. DigitalOcean Droplet). An internet network connection (eg. DigitalOcean network).

      <description>To host a web service, one of the first things you will need is to register your domain name. This will be the domain name used for all of your service links, and it is what your users will need to type into their browsers (or click on) to visit your pages.&#xA;Public domain names are a scarce resource. Because of their scarcity, you must pay for your domain registrations, doing so in 1 year increments.</description>

      <title>Setup public DNS service</title>

      <description>A DNS server maps your domain (and all subdomain) names to the various IP addresses of your servers. DNS is required for your users to be able to type (or click on) your domain name prod.example.com and have it resolve to the IP address that is required to contact your Docker server (prod). Beyond this, DNS is also a means of proving to a third party that you are the owner (controller) of your own domain, which is used as a part of the ACME challenge that Letâ€™s Encrypt (or Step-CA) uses when signing your TLS certificates.</description>

      <title>Create a public server (VPS)</title>
      <link>https://book.rymcg.tech/d.rymcg.tech/required-infrastructure/public-docker-server/index.html</link>

      <description>This section will guide you to create your own public Docker server, using a DigitalOcean droplet as an example. In a similar fashion, you can install Docker on any cloud provider, or dedicated host that you prefer.&#xA;Choosing a VPS provider One of the most basic units of cloud computing is the Virtual Private Server (VPS). A VPS is a (Linux) virtual machine that is provisioned by a cloud service, and you are given root access to fully administer it, to install whatever you want on it.</description>
