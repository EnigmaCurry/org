    <description>Traefik Proxy (Traefik) is a core service, an application gateway, for all of the service containers installed on your Docker host. Traefik is an advanced software router: it can serve hundreds of deployed application containers (routes) at the same time. Traefik has a configuration provider that operates by discovery, so that when it is installed on a Docker host, it can automatically configure itself based upon the runtime settings of each individual application it finds.</description>
