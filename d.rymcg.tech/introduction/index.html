<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-self-hosting">What is self-hosting?</h2>
<p>Self-hosting is the practice of hosting network applications (web /
internet / LAN / etc), using your own server hardware, or at least on
virtual machines that you fundamentally control (ie. you have root
access). As a preparedness skill, the self-hoster prioritizes the use
of open source software, as it becomes an inalienable toolset to
bootstrap infrastructure in the wilderness.</p>
<p>You can apply self-hosting a little bit, or a lot. On the one hand,
you could post all of your content on Facebook (obviously, this is
<em>not</em> self-hosting), and on the other hand you could build all your
servers yourself, from parts, and run them in your basement, on your
own network, bootstrapping everything. For most people though,
self-hosting means to use a Raspberry Pi at home, or a cloud computing
provider that offers you a generic Linux VPS (virtual private server)
on the public internet, to configure in any way you wish, but still
letting the cloud provider handle the hardware and network side of
things for a monthly fee.</p>
<p>Demarcate your own level of abstraction. Test that your operations
work in a generic way, portable to any other provider at the same
level of abstraction. Try running it entirely at home, at least for
development purposes. Don&rsquo;t get locked into a single vendor. Use open
source software, or software you built yourself. This is self-hosting.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Docker</a> is a software platform for running containers on Linux.
Containers let you install and run software in an isolated and generic
way. It solves the problems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell" rel="external" target="_blank">&ldquo;dependency hell&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://donthitsave.com/comic/2016/07/15/it-works-on-my-computer" rel="external" target="_blank">&ldquo;But it works on
my computer!&rdquo;</a>, for all Linux distributions. Containers are created
from images that include <em>all</em> of their dependencies, including the
operating system to support it. The only thing a container does <em>not</em>
include, is the Linux kernel, which is shared from the host with all
the containers running on the same host. This abstraction makes it
work the same way on all computers, regardless of Linux distribution
(assuming an up to date kernel). Docker maintains persistent volumes
for each container, so that they may mount it into their own virtual
filesystem, and thus storing all of its important data into the
volume. You may upgrade, or even delete these containers, and as long
as you keep the volume(s), you can simply reprovision the same images
(even on new hardware), and the containers will load all of its same
data from before.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-container">What is a container?</h2>
<p>Although it is possible to run desktop software inside of a Docker
container, 99% of the time a Docker container is created to run a
<em>service</em>, assumed to run on a server, assumed to be serving remote
clients. Generally, a container is designed only to run a single
service. For example: <em>A</em> web server, <em>a</em> chat server, <em>a</em> DNS server,
<em>a</em> python server you write, etc. Multiple instances of the same image
can run as separate containers, and they can even share volumes, if
you want (though generally not).</p>
<p>Containers are related to a different technology that you might
already be familar with: Virtual Machines. However, there are several
fundamental differences between containers and virtual machines, and
so it is useful to describe them here as a comparison:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Container</th>
<th>Virtual Machine</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Kernel</td>
<td>Containers share a kernel with the host</td>
<td>VMs runs their own kernel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware</td>
<td>Containers share hardware with the host, but with the addition of a permissions model to access it</td>
<td>VMs use hardware virtualization features</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Memory</td>
<td>Containers share memory with the host</td>
<td>VMs use a fixed size virtual hardware memory space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disk</td>
<td>Containers share storage system with the host (volumes live under <code>/var/lib/docker/</code> by default)</td>
<td>VMs use a fixed size (but expandable) virtual hard disk image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Network</td>
<td>Containers support Host level networking, or can do NAT</td>
<td>NAT or bridge network, not host level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Execution model</td>
<td>Containers are just a regular Linux processes, run under a given user account</td>
<td>VMs run their own kernel and init (systemd)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Init process</td>
<td>Containers don&rsquo;t need an init process, Docker runs the containers process (CMD) directly</td>
<td>VMs run their own kernel and init (systemd)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process isolation</td>
<td>Containers run as as regular Linux processes, which have a capabilities system to limit privileges</td>
<td>VMs are like a separate machine, and a have a separate process space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Root filesystem</td>
<td>Containers inherit a root filesystem from their image, which contain all the application files, and the OS, minus a kernel</td>
<td>VMs are run from (linked) virtual disk images</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Volumes</td>
<td>Containers automatically mount volumes provided from Docker. Docker maintains the lifecycle of these volumes.</td>
<td>VMs can have multiple virtual disks, or manually mount remote volumes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Containerization uses features of the Linux kernel, (specifically,
namespaces and cgroups). For the purposes of this book, the term
&ldquo;container&rdquo; will always imply that it is running on a Linux host; it
is inseparable from the host kernel, and it can&rsquo;t work without it!
(You may be aware that you can install a product called &ldquo;Docker
Desktop&rdquo; on Windows or MacOS. This product installs a Linux virtual
machine on your host OS and runs Docker inside it, and then it
installs the docker client on the host OS, so it appears seamless.)</p>
<p>In a general context, there are other OS containers, like Windows
containers, however they are on the fringe, and will not be discussed
in this book. Containers imply Linux.</p>
<p>Docker is a good platform to pick for self-hosting containers, because
it&rsquo;s a mature open source project, and it works on virtually any Linux
computer or VPS. Docker is server focussed, and therefore ideal for
self-hosting. Docker is easy to get started with, even if you&rsquo;re a
beginner.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-docker-compose">What is Docker Compose?</h2>
<p>Docker uses a client-server API pattern of control. You install the
Docker daemon on a server machine, and this machine is called the
Docker Host. Usually you interact with the API through the command
line <code>docker</code> tool. Docker provides primitive commands for running
single containers directly, with <code>docker run</code>. However, for larger
projects that need more than one container (eg. a webserver + a
database) and need to be able to talk to one another, <code>docker run</code> is
not the best tool to use.</p>
<p><code>docker compose</code> is a command that operates your containers from a
project level abstraction. <code>docker compose</code> lets you define all the
containers and volumes that you need for a given project, in a
declarative way, in a <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file.</p>
<p>With <code>docker compose</code> you can start/stop/delete all the project
containers together, as a single unit.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-d-dot-rymcg-dot-tech">What is d.rymcg.tech?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/d.rymcg.tech" rel="external" target="_blank">d.rymcg.tech</a> is a collection of docker compose projects for various
open source server applications, but it can also be used as a template
for your own services. It has an integrated frontend proxy (<a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/" rel="external" target="_blank">Traefik
Proxy)</a>, including sentry authorization middleware (mTLS, OAuth2, or
HTTP Basic auth) and IP address filtering. It is a framework for
packaging your own applications, and managing several container
instances at the same time, each with seprate configs in .env files.</p>
<p>d.rymcg.tech focuses on the config rules of the <a href="https://12factor.net/config" rel="external" target="_blank">12-factor principle</a>.
All of the configuration for a container should be specified as
environment variables, which Docker loads from a standard <code>.env</code> file.
All of the data for a container should live inside a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/" rel="external" target="_blank">Docker Volume</a>
(not a bind mount), and so the lifecycle of the volume is maintained
by Docker directly.</p>
<p><strong>d.rymcg.tech is designed to run on a workstation, not the docker
host</strong>. The Docker server API is accessed remotely over SSH. Only your
personal workstation should be used to issue <code>docker</code> commands that
affect the server, they should never be run on the server itself. It&rsquo;s
important to keep the server as bare bones and hands off as possible.
The server&rsquo;s only job is to <em>run</em> containers. The job of <em>configuring</em>
them is always performed from a remote workstation. Once the server is
setup, you won&rsquo;t normally need to even login to the server console
ever again. By controlling the server from your workstation, you can
manage the server in a clean fashion. You can even create a new server
from scratch, in no time. All of the important configuration stays on
your workstation (and are backed up in a git repository).</p>
